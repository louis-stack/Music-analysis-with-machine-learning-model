# Music-analysis-with-machine-learning-model
A complete machine learning model that aims to extract information from a music input.

My goal : 
- Detect the name and the author of a music (EVEN a cover)  / (Shazam+)
- Detect the genre of a music / (spotify)
- Detect all music intruments 
- Detect every music chords

Additional features
- Generate a music sheet of every intruments




The 4 steps for analyzing music with neural networks include:
1. Collecting data
2. Preprocessing audio data
3. Training the neural network
4. Testing and evaluating the network
